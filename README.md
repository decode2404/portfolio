# portfolio
This project is a modern, responsive personal portfolio website designed and developed to showcase my professional profile, technical skills, and projects in a clean and engaging way. The portfolio serves as a central platform to present my work, experience, and contact information to recruiters, interviewers, and collaborators.

The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following modern frontend development practices. Special attention has been given to UI/UX design, responsiveness, and smooth animations to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

The portfolio includes well-structured sections such as:

Hero / Introduction section with a modern design and engaging layout

About section highlighting background, interests, and goals

Skills section visualizing technical strengths

Projects section displaying featured projects with descriptions

Contact section with an interactive form for easy communication

To enhance user experience, the website implements CSS animations, transitions, and JavaScript-driven interactions, such as scroll-based effects, hover animations, and form handling. The layout is crafted to maintain consistency, readability, and accessibility while keeping performance in mind.

This project reflects my understanding of frontend fundamentals, responsive web design, clean code practices, and interactive UI development. It also acts as a continuously evolving project where new features, design improvements, and optimizations can be added as I grow my skills in full-stack development.
